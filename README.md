Eat-Da-Burger

This is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers that you would like to eat. 
When you submit your burger's name, it will then have a devoured button next to it asking if you would like to devoure it. When the burger is devoured it will move to the Have Eaten part. All burgers are stored in the database even if they are not devoured.
